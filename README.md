### `TWEETER` - Reverse Engineered Twitter

Tweeter is a web application that gives you a space to share anything that's important to you through small bits of text.  For this application I reverse engineered some integral features of the Twitter platform.  Users are able to sign up, sign in and start sharing!  I also wanted to make it look just like the actual Twitter page and created my own custom CSS for this project.  There are bits of Bootsrap in here, however, it's only adding small things like "w-100" and the occasional "d-flex."

### `FEATURES`

Tweeter has 4 main pages:

> Sign up / Sign in pages (+ also modals)

> Landing page with all Tweets

> Profile page

> Tweet page to show all comments

With Tweeter you can `sign up` providing your name, email, username, password (must match), profile avatar image URL and profile banner image URL.  Once signed up you have the `ability to edit all of your user account settings` as well.  Then you can start `creating your own Tweets` and if you don't like it you can `delete your own Tweet.`  You can `browse all Tweets` on the landing page and if you find one that you like you can `comment on all Tweets` to share your thoughts.

Whenever you computer is in dark mode the theme will also change automatically.  Toggling through dark and light mode will give you drastically different views.
